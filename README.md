- [x] working on 224
- [x] so, 224 is working, but it learns for few epochs after which there is a burst in the learning. Now the thing is to figure out why the hell is this happening...I have tried an experiement wwhere I reduce the learning rate.. but it just feels like waiting for impending doom. Farce deep Learning. 
- [x] Bloody hell it worked with reducing LR. The whole point is, reducing the learning rate is the only intution any deep learning ahem ahem researcher will have. coz aint no one got any idea about momentum.
