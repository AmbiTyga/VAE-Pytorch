TODO:
- [ ] Remove the hard-coding of the variable sizes..
- [ ] cleant he code.. make classes. 
- [x] working on 224
- [ ] so, 224 is working, but it learns for few epochs after which there is a burst in the learning. Now the thing is to figure out why the hell is this happening...I have tried an experiement wwhere I reduce the learning rate.. but it just feels like waiting for impending doom. Farce deep Learning.
